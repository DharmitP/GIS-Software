(03.21.17)

Welcome to GIS-43! This is a mapping application built for the ECE297 course at 
the University of Toronto by team 043 (Daniyal Qureshi, Dharmit Patel, Xingyu Ma). 
This help reference includes basic instructions for new users.



--CONTROLS--

A map is LOADED at the initial TERMINAL. Once the map is loaded, PANNING is done 
by holding down the centre MOUSE SCROLL button while MOVING. ZOOMING is done 
by using the MOUSE SCROLL (scroll UP for ZOOM IN, DOWN for ZOOM OUT). 



--MAP--

The NAMES of streets and points of interest are present at lower levels of zoom.
Features are distinguished by colour.

GEOGRAPHY is represented by:

Colour			 | Type 
----------------------------------------------------------------
BLUE		 	-- WATERWAY (River, lake)
LIGHT GREEN    		-- PARKS (Gardens, small parks)
DARK GREEN     		-- GREENSPACE (Larger parks)
PEACH			-- SHORE (Beachline)

ROADS are represented by:

Colour			 | Type 
----------------------------------------------------------------
WHITE		 	-- ROAD (Highway, side-road)
ORANGE		   	-- MOTORWAY (Trunk, motorway)
WHITE, DASHED  		-- TRACK (Footpath)



--INTERFACE--

There are two primary modes, SEARCH and DIRECTIONS. Search mode allows the user
to find specific intersections, streets & points of interest while directions
mode allows the user to find the quickest path from a certain intersection to 
a point of interest or another intersection. 

By DEFAULT, SEARCH is selected but the mode can be selected by pressing the 
branch (directions) or magnifying glass (search) buttons to the right of the
searchbar at the top-left of the GUI.

Whenever the user CLICKS on the map in search mode, a marker will be dropped 
at that location and informative details will be printed out to console. In 
directions mode, by clicking on another location after that, the shortest 
path will be displayed to get from the previous location to this new one.
Pressing the screen twice will erase the marker.



--SEARCHBAR & SIDEBAR BUTTONS--

In search or directions mode, the user may select what they are searching for 
by pressing the buttons directly below the searchbar. The ROAD indicates 
STREET, the FLAG indicates POINTS OF INTEREST and the CROSSING ARROWS indicate
INTERSECTION. 

To begin a search, the user can CLICK onto the searchbar and begin typing. The
search will begin once the user presses the ENTER key - if the feature is found
it will be drawn on the screen. If not, an error message will be printed.

To begin a directions search, the user can CLICK on the searchbar and begin 
typing their starting INTERSECTION. The user presses ENTER and then they can
continue typing their DESTINATION. The user presses ENTER again and the 
quickest path between two points with the specified names will be drawn if they
are found. If not, an error message will be printed. 

Streets and points of interest are inputted by their name. To TYPE an
INTERSECTION, enter the streets which intersect there, separated by ampersand 
(&): e.g. 'St. George Street & College Street'. 



--POINTS OF INTEREST & FILTERING--

Points of interest are depicted by icons on the map. The type of landmark is
specified by the icon displayed:

Icon			 | Type 
----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOON & MUG 		-- RESTAURANT (Cafes, fast food, bars)
BUS         		-- BUSSTOP (Transit)
CROSS       		-- HEALTHCARE (Pharmacies, hospitals, clinics)
LETTER      		-- POST (Post offices)
PRAYING 		-- PLACE OF WORSHIP (Temples, churches, mosques)
BOOK			-- EDUCATION (Libraries, schools, colleges)
CIRCLE			-- MISCELLANEOUS 

To change what type of points of interest the user wants to display onscreen,
press the FILTER button (flag with gear, below HELP button). The current icons
being DISPLAYED will be highlighted in BLUE; to toggle them simply press the 
icon. Press a HIDDEN icon to show it again. To close this menu, press the GO 
(blue ARROW) button at the bottom.
